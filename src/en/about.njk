    <article class="story-block">
      <h3>1. Foundation: learning how to think</h3>
      <p>
        My degree in Industrial Engineering at UFRJ was defining. Engineering gave me a solid base for logical reasoning,
        scenario reading, decision-making under constraints, and a deep understanding of trade-offs and consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than methods or tools, I developed a way to approach complex problems without looking for shortcuts.
        A systemic view of processes—inputs, outputs, interdependencies—combined with a quality and continuous improvement lens,
        shaped my work from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
        This foundation enabled a consultant and strategist mindset, with strong observation, analysis, and reflection before action—a trait that
        runs throughout my professional trajectory.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="story-block">
      <h3>2. Turning point: impact as a deliberate choice</h3>
      <p>
        In 2013, my path shifted meaningfully. I became more deeply involved in volunteer work and connected with TETO, an organization
        focused on tackling extreme poverty. That experience was a turning point.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t just about “helping”; it meant revisiting priorities and criteria for action. From there, I pursued training in impact business,
        participating in programs such as Yunus Social Business, Recode, and Instituto Quintessa.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that period, my entrepreneurial drive consolidated around a question that still guides me:
        <strong>how do you structure initiatives that make sense in the real world and remain sustainable over time?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In parallel, I deepened my work on self-awareness and consciousness, recognizing that organizational transformation does not happen through
        techniques alone. That led me to Gaia Education, expanding my sustainability lens and qualifying me as a trainer.
      </p>
      <p>
        This human development path made something central clear: methods don’t operate by themselves—people do. From that, I developed a leadership lens
        oriented toward collaboration, collective intelligence, and the creation of environments where desired outcomes become possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that context, I also trained in the Pedagogy of Cooperation, enabling me as a group facilitator—able to structure, plan, and lead workshops,
        journeys, and collective processes with meaning.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="story-block">
      <h3>3. Two tracks that evolve together: corporate and education</h3>
      <p>
        While deepening impact and human development, I continued an intense corporate path as an executive and consultant—working under pressure for results,
        growth, governance, and difficult decisions in structures not always prepared for contemporary complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing my MSc in Business Administration (Strategy & Sustainability) at PUC-Rio, education became even more central.
        I entered formal teaching—undergraduate, postgraduate, MBAs, and executive programs—and never left.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teaching became a natural extension of practice: a space to organize thinking, exchange perspectives, and translate real experiences into applied learning.
        Beyond academia, I led educational and training programs for refugees, open courses, and learning initiatives in diverse contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an executive, I saw clearly that strong outcomes depend on well-structured systems. Based on my experience across processes, projects, and products,
        I began structuring workflows, governance models, and decision systems that generated measurable results across oil & gas, energy, infrastructure,
        health, education, and technology.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="story-block">
      <h3>4. Today: integrate, share, and sustain</h3>
      <p>
        Today, my focus is on strategic organizational consulting—working side by side with leaders and teams to design, review, and structure functional
        workflows that connect strategy to day-to-day execution.
      </p>

      <ul class="about-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Map and reorganize workflows</strong> across areas, reducing noise, rework, and informal dependencies;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Structure decision systems</strong> with clear criteria, defined autonomy levels, and governance rituals that sustain consistent choices over time;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integrate processes, projects, and products</strong> into coherent operating models, avoiding method overlap and fragmented effort;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support leaders</strong> transitioning from improvisation or excessive control toward systems based on clarity, distributed accountability,
          and continuous learning.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I’m fluent in technology and data, which allows a pragmatic approach to structuring functional work systems: indicators, dashboards, follow-up routines,
        prioritization criteria, and the intelligent use of digital tools as decision support—never as an end in themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with organizations operating in complex, regulated, or changing environments where generic solutions fail. My role is to help build sustainable
        work architectures adapted to the real context, the people involved, and the constraints in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        In parallel, I continue developing independent projects, teaching and mentoring, and maintaining spaces for reflection and listening—so the human dimension
        remains present in any organizational system.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than delivering diagnostics or frameworks, my work is to create the conditions for organizations to decide better, work with more clarity, and sustain
        results over time.
